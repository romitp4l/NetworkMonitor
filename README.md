## Network Monitor App Report

**1. Introduction**

The Network Monitor app is a basic Android utility designed to provide users with essential information about their device's network connectivity. It offers features for checking connection status, viewing detailed network information, and performing ping tests. This report details the app's features, functionality, and implementation.

**2. Features**

The Network Monitor app includes the following key features:

*   **Connection Status Check:** Determines the type of network connection currently active (Wi-Fi, Mobile Data, Ethernet, or No Connection).
*   **Network Details:** Displays detailed information about the active network, including:
    *   Network Type
    *   IP Address
    *   Wi-Fi SSID (if connected to Wi-Fi)
    *   Wi-Fi BSSID (if connected to Wi-Fi)
*   **Ping Test:** Performs a ping test to a user-specified IP address or URL, displaying the results in a scrollable text view.
*   **About Screen:** Provides information about the app, including its description, version, and developer.

**3. Functionality and Implementation**

**3.1 Connection Status Check**

*   **Implementation:** Uses the `ConnectivityManager` and `NetworkCapabilities` classes to determine the active network and its transport type.
*   **Functionality:** The app checks for the presence of `TRANSPORT_WIFI`, `TRANSPORT_CELLULAR`, and `TRANSPORT_ETHERNET` to identify the connection type. If no active network is found, it reports "No Connection."

**3.2 Network Details**

*   **Implementation:** Retrieves network information using `ConnectivityManager`, `NetworkCapabilities`, `LinkProperties`, and `WifiManager`.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   **Network Type:** Determined using the same method as the connection status check.
    *   **IP Address:** Retrieved from `LinkProperties` and formatted as a string.
    *   **SSID and BSSID:** Obtained from `WifiManager` if the device is connected to a Wi-Fi network.
*   **Display:** The information is displayed in a dedicated activity (`NetworkDetailsActivity`) with appropriate labels.

**3.3 Ping Test**

*   **Implementation:** Executes the `ping` command using `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`. The output of the command is read from the process's input stream.
*   **Functionality:** The user enters an IP address or URL in an `EditText` field. Upon clicking the "Ping" button, the command is executed, and the output is displayed in a `TextView`. The ping operation is performed in an `AsyncTask` to avoid blocking the main thread.
*   **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is included to catch `IOExceptions` that may occur during the ping process.

**3.4 About Screen**

*   **Implementation:** A simple activity (`AboutActivity`) with `TextView` elements to display information about the app.
*   **Functionality:** Displays the app's name, description, version, and developer information. The layout is designed to be visually appealing and modern, with an app logo, clear typography, and appropriate spacing.

**4. Technology Stack**

*   **Programming Language:** Kotlin
*   **UI Design:** XML layouts
*   **Android SDK:** Minimum SDK version (to be specified based on your target devices)
*   **Key Android APIs:**
    *   `ConnectivityManager`
    *   `NetworkCapabilities`
    *   `LinkProperties`
    *   `WifiManager`
    *   `AsyncTask`
    *   `Runtime`

**5. User Interface (UI)**

The app's UI is designed to be simple and intuitive. The main activity provides buttons for checking the connection, viewing network details, and performing pings. The `NetworkDetailsActivity` and `AboutActivity` present information in a clear and organized manner. The `PingActivity` provides an input field for the target address and a scrollable text view to display the ping results.

**6. Future Enhancements**

*   **More Detailed Network Information:** Include additional network details, such as signal strength, link speed, DNS server addresses, and gateway information.
*   **Graphical Representation of Ping Results:** Display ping results in a graph or chart for better visualization.
*   **Network Scanning:** Add the ability to scan for devices on the local network.
*   **Traceroute Functionality:** Implement traceroute to visualize the network path to a target address.
*   **Improved Error Handling and User Feedback:** Provide more informative error messages and user feedback during network operations.
*   **Dark Mode Support:** Implement dark mode for improved user experience in low-light conditions.

**7. Conclusion**

The Network Monitor app provides a useful set of tools for basic network monitoring on Android devices. Its simple interface and core features make it a practical utility for users who need to quickly check their network connectivity and gather basic network information. The suggested future enhancements can further improve the app's functionality and user experience.
